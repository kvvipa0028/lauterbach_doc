G1099325  H Training Simulator and Demo Software
G1113611  H Training Simulator and Demo Software
G1596050  X Version
G1596052  H About the Demo
G1596056  X What is this? This is a guided tour through TRACE32 - a tutorial. We use a simple program example in C to illustrate the most important debug features, and give lots of helpful tips & tricks for everyday use. How long does this tutorial take? 0.5 to 1 hrs.
G1723411  X How can I learn most from this tutorial? Work completely through all chapters in sequence and then do the quiz at the end. Where can I download the TRACE32 Simulator for the hands-on debug session? From: http://www.lauterbach.com/download.html. You do not need any hardware for this tutorial.
G1595426  H Starting the TRACE32 Simulator
G1595590  X Unzip the downloaded file. You do not need to install the TRACE32 Simulator.
G1640047  X Double-click the t32m<architecture>.exe file (e.g. t32marm.exe) to start the demo debug session. When the TRACE32 Simulator starts, a start-up PRACTICE script that sets up a debug session is automatically executed.
G1596235  X You can manually execute the same start-up PRACTICE script by choosing File menu > Run Batchfile.
G1682908  X PRACTICE, the Lauterbach script language, is used for automating tests, configuring the TRACE32 GUI and your debug environment.
G1723749  X For our demo debug session, the PRACTICE start-up script armc.cmm loads the application program armle.axf and generates a TRACE32 internal symbol database out of the loaded information.
G1572803  H User Interface - TRACE32 PowerView
G1572813  X The graphical user interface (GUI) of TRACE32 is called TRACE32 PowerView, see screenshot below. Well briefly explain the GUI using the Data.List command and Data.List window as an example.
G1601777  H Program Listing and Program Counter
G1680875  X Do one of the following to open the Data.List window:
G1601922  X Choose View menu > List Source
G1602256  X or, at the TRACE32 command line, type: Data.List
G1602257  X The Data.List window displays the code in assembler mnemonic and HLL.
G1706356  X In the Data.List window, the gray bar indicates the position of the program counter (PC). Right now, it is located on the symbolic address of the label main. This is because the program counter (PC) is instructed in the start-up PRACTICE script, as follows:
G1706359  E ;Set CPU register Program Counter (PC) to the address of the label main.
G1706360  E Register.Set PC main
G1681723  H TRACE32 Commands
G1683107  X You can execute commands in TRACE32 PowerView via the usual suspects:
G1681724  X Menus on the menu bar
G1681725  X Buttons on the main toolbar and the buttons on the toolbars of TRACE32 windows
G1681727  X Context menus in TRACE32 windows
G1683098  X Additionally in TRACE32, you can execute commands via the TRACE32 command line and the softkeys below the command line.
G1683100  H TRACE32 Command Line and Softkeys
G1683101  X TRACE32 commands are not case sensitive:  register.view is the same as Register.view
G1680233  X UPPER CASE letters indicate the short forms of commands and must not be omitted. All lower case letters can be omitted. This makes short forms an efficient time saver when you are entering frequently-used commands in the command line. Examples:
G1662222  X Instead of the full form Register.view type just the short form r or R
G1662226  X Instead of the full form Data.List type just the short form d.l or D.L
G1623984  X The softkeys are below the command line. The camel casing (i.e. upper and lower case letters) on any softkey tells you the full form of a command. The softkeys guide you through the command input, displaying all possible commands and parameters.
G1584896  X Example - To assemble the Data.dump command using the softkeys:
G1624165  X Click Data.
G1624178  X Click dump.
G1624094  X Type the <range> or <address> you want to dump. For example, 0x1000--0x2000
G1624095  X Click [ok] to execute the command. The Data.dump window opens.
G1679140  H Single Stepping
G1679141  X The basic debug commands are available via the Run menu, the toolbar of the Data.List window, the main toolbar, and via the TRACE32 command line.
G1681888  X Single stepping  is one of the basic debug commands.
G1682397  X TRACE32 provides also more complex debug control commands. You can run or step until an expression changes or becomes true.
G1722910  X Example: Var.Step.Till i>11. single-steps the program until the variable i becomes greater than 11. The trailing dot is very important! It is the dot that formats 11 as a decimal number.
G1723011  X Note: i>11. is equivalent to i>0xB
G1715089  H Window Captions - What makes them special in TRACE32
G1715090  X The command with which you open a window will be shown as the window caption. The parameters and options are also included in the window caption.
G1715102  X You can re-insert a command from a window caption (a) into the command line (b) in order to modify the command. Lets do this with the Register window.
G1715117  X Choose View menu > Register.
G1715118  X Right-click the window caption (a).
G1715119  X Modify the command, e.g. by adding the /SpotLight option: It will highlight changed registers.
G1715120  X Click [ok] to execute the modified command.
G1715272  X Click  Single Step on the TRACE32 toolbar. Changed registers are highlighted immediately.
G1572855  H Memory
G1571255  H Displaying Memory
G1593881  X To display a memory dump in a Data.dump window, do one of the following:
